# Implementing-Graph-SLAM
Abstract: As for autonomous systems, to naviagte from its current location to the goal location, the first challenge which an autonomous system faces is localizing itself with respect to the world, in this project, I tried to localize the robot in the simulated world using specific localization techniques in this case using Graph-SLAM.
The pipeline for this project:
1. Defining the properties of robot and the world.
2. Defining functions like (move, sense for robot) and landmarks present in the world.
3. Initializing the constraints, omega and Xi
4. Implementing Graph-SLAM.
5. Testing Graph-SLAM.
